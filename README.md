# Learn Data Structures & Algorithms with JS :books: 


This repository :open_file_folder: is a training center for technical knowledge on data structuring and algorithms in javascript. 
I am currently learning these notions with the help of the book **Data Structures & Algorithms with JavaScript** available for free [here](https://b-ok.cc/book/2329436/522069). 

:dart: My goal is to master these concepts in order to design more robust, more efficient *backend APIs* to guarantee a better flexibility in their deployment. 

In my files, you'll find definitions, examples of the book and my results of the proposed exercises.   


## This book covers :memo::

- [x] **Arrays and lists:** the most common data structures
- [x] **Stacks and queues:** more complex list-like data structures
- [x] **Linked lists:** how they overcome the shortcomings of arrays
- [x] **Dictionaries:** storing data as key-value pairs
- [x] **Hashing:** good for quick insertion and retrieval
- [x] **Sets:** useful for storing unique elements that appear only once
- [x] **Binary Trees:** storing data in a hierarchical manner
- [x] **Graphs and graph algorithms:** ideal for modeling networks
- [x] **Algorithms:** including those that help you sort or search data
- [x] **Advanced algorithms:** dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
